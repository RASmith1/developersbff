These skills include planning the website pages and corresponding routes, installing Composer, incorporating dependencies obtained from packagist.org and/or github, committing modifications to github.com, setting up facades, adjusting environment settings, coding the routes, creating views and templates, using Blade syntax, passing data to views, testing the URLs, and deploying the new website to the server.
